## Overview

A repository hosting (a work-in-progress for) the digitised and curated dataset of the Holle List vocabularies of languages off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia [@holle1987; @holleli1980]. The goal is to allow computational matching between the vocabularies of these languages with the [main, digitised Holle List](https://engganolang.github.io/digitised-holle-list/) [@rajeg2023]. The matching will provide the English, Dutch, and Indonesian translations for these vocabularies that are carried over from the main Holle List.

### Notes

- Files in the `plaintexts` directory that are done are:

    - lekon.txt (✅)
    
    - simalur.txt (✅)
    
    - tapah.txt (✅)
    
    - mentawai1933.txt (✅)

These files will be supplemented by the additional data from different languages (see the note below).

- The digitisation process for the lists of [Mentawai]{style="color:crimson"} (not the "1933" one), [Nias (1905 and 1911)]{style="color:crimson"}, [Salang and Sigule]{style="color:crimson"}, [Sigulei and Salang]{style="color:crimson"}, and [Seumalur]{style="color:crimson"} was conducted by my students at the English Lexicology and Lexicography course in the Bachelor of English Literature, Faculty of Humanities, Udayana University. This is part of a class project to introduce WeSay app to the students.

    - UPDATE: The .sfm plain-text files from the WeSay projects are to be further processed (particularly matching the main word list with the notes)
